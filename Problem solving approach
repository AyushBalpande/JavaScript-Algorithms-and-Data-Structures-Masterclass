*Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns*

OBJECTIVES
Define what an algorithm is
Devise a plan to solve algorithms
Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

Why do I need to know this?
Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer

HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?
Devise a plan for solving problems
Master common problem solving patterns

PROBLEM SOLVING
Understand the Problem
Explore Concrete Examples
Break It Down
Solve/Simplify
Look Back and Refactor

UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
Can I restate the problem in my own words?
What are the inputs that go into the problem?
What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
